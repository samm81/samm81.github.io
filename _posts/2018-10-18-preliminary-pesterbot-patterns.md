title: Preliminary Pesterbot Patterns
---

For those of you who unaware, I have been working on and using a personal project of mine for the last three years that I coined [pesterbot][1]. I won't go into the details here, but the basic idea is that it messages you on Facebook Messenger every 15 minutes asking you what you're up to. You respond, and you end up with a huge log of what you were up to on any given day for the past three years. 1.6 megabytes of a log in fact.

In addition, for the past two years or so I've been using a service called [Moodscope][2] to keep tabs on my mood every day. Shortly after waking up I hop on the website which asks me to rate myself on a scale from zero to three on twenty different 'cards', like 'attentive' or 'upset'. They turn this into a score from zero to one hundred. I've been doing that for about two years or so and the log is a disappointing 7.2 kilobytes.

Recently my friend [Pei-fen Tu][3] had the idea to mash the two together and see if we could find any interesting patterns. So she and I took a look! We present the Preliminary Pesterbot Patterns Jupyter Notebook. (Scroll to the 'Correlation' section for results).
